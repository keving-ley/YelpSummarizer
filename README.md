# YelpSummarizer

This project will summarize and condense Yelp reviews into one review for any specified restaurant. The way that this will occur is through "Extractive Summarization." The algorithm parses each review into bigrams, tags them, categorizes them, and then ranks every phrase based on relevancy. Relevancy will be determined by several metrics, notably the number of times it occurs, and number of popular categories the phrase encompasses. The top snippets will be incorporated into the resulting summary review.
